# Download accessibility estimates with population and land use data

Download estimates of access to employment, health, education and social
assistance services by transport mode and time of the day for the cities
included in the AOP project. See the documentation 'Details' for the
data dictionary. The data set reports information for each heaxgon in a
H3 spatial grid at resolution 9, with a side of 174 meters and an area
of 0.10 km2. More information about H3 at
<https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/>.

## Usage

``` r
read_access(
  city = NULL,
  mode = "walk",
  peak = TRUE,
  year = 2019,
  geometry = FALSE,
  showProgress = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- city:

  Character. A city name or three-letter abbreviation. If `city="all"`,
  the function returns data for all cities.

- mode:

  Character. A transport mode. Modes available include
  'public_transport', 'bicycle', or 'walk' (the default).

- peak:

  Logical. If `TRUE` (the default), returns accessibility estimates
  during peak time, between 6am and 8am. If `FALSE`, returns
  accessibility during off-peak, between 2pm and 4am. This argument only
  takes effect when `mode` is either `car` or `public_transport`.

- year:

  Numeric. A year number in YYYY format. Defaults to 2019.

- geometry:

  Logical. If `FALSE` (the default), returns a regular data.table of aop
  data. If `TRUE`, returns an `sf data.frame` with simple feature
  geometry of spatial hexagonal grid H3. See details in
  [read_grid](https://ipeagit.github.io/aopdata/dev/reference/read_grid.md).

- showProgress:

  Logical. Defaults to `TRUE` display progress bar.

## Value

A `data.frame` object

| temporal      | year       | Year of reference |                                      |

The name of the columns with accessibility estimates are the junction of
three components: 1) Type of accessibility indicator 2) Type of
opportunity / population 3) Time threshold

### 1) Type of accessibility indicator

|               |                                          |                                                                                                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| CMA           | Cumulative opportunity measure (active)  |                                                                                                       |
| CMP           | Cumulative opportunity measure (passive) |                                                                                                       |
| TMI           | Travel time to closest opportunity       | Value = Inf when travel time is longer than 2h (public transport or car) or 1,5h (walking or bicycle) |

### 2) Type of opportunity / population

|                         |                                                |                                                |

## Examples

``` r
# Read accessibility estimates of a single city
df <- read_access(
  city = 'Fortaleza',
  mode = 'public_transport',
  year = 2019,
  showProgress = FALSE
)
#> Using mode public_transport
#> Downloading accessibility data for the year 2019
#> Downloading land use data for the year 2019
#> Downloading population data for the year 2010

# Read accessibility estimates for all cities
all <- read_access(
  city = 'all',
  mode = 'walk',
  year = 2019,
  showProgress = FALSE
)
#> Using mode walk
#> Downloading accessibility data for the year 2019
#> Downloading land use data for the year 2019
#> Downloading population data for the year 2010
