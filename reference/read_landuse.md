# Download land use and population data

Download data on the spatial distribution of population, jobs, schools,
health care and social assitance facilities at a fine spatial resolution
for the cities included in the AOP project. See the documentation
'Details' for the data dictionary. The data set reports information for
each heaxgon in a H3 spatial grid at resolution 9, with a side of 174
meters and an area of 0.10 km2. More information about H3 at
<https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/>.

## Usage

``` r
read_landuse(city = NULL, year = 2019, geometry = FALSE, showProgress = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- city:

  Character. A city name or three-letter abbreviation. If `city="all"`,
  the function returns data for all cities.

- year:

  Numeric. A year number in YYYY format. Defaults to 2019.

- geometry:

  Logical. If `FALSE` (the default), returns a regular data.table of aop
  data. If `TRUE`, returns an `sf data.frame` with simple feature
  geometry of spatial hexagonal grid H3. See details in
  [read_grid](https://ipeagit.github.io/aopdata/reference/read_grid.md).

- showProgress:

  Logical. Defaults to `TRUE` display progress bar.

## Value

A `data.frame` object or an `sf data.frame` object
