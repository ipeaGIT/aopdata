This vignette introduces the **`aopdata`** package, lists the cities for which data are available for download, and presents the data dictionary.

**`aopdata`** is an R package that makes it easy to download data from the 
[Access to Opportunities Project (AOP)](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/). 
AOP is a research initiative led by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea) 
that aims to study transport accessibility and inequalities in access to opportunities 
in Brazilian cities. You can access more information about the project on the [AOP website](https://www.ipea.gov.br/acessooportunidades/en/).


## Installation

You can install `aopdata` from CRAN, or the development version from GitHub.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# CRAN
install.packages('aopdata')

# github
devtools::install_github("ipeaGIT/aopdata", subdir = "r-package")
```

## Usage

After installation, you can easily download accessibility estimates, as well as 
population and land use data, from 20 major Brazilian cities. Those cities are:

| **Abbreviation** | **City Name**       |
|--------------|-----------------|
| bel          | Belem           |
| bho          | Belo Horizonte  |
| bsb          | Brasilia        |
| cam          | Campinas        |
| cgr          | Campo Grande    |
| cur          | Curitiba        |
| duq          | Duque de Caxias |
| for          | Fortaleza       |
| goi          | Goiania         |
| gua          | Guarulhos       |
| mac          | Maceio          |
| man          | Manaus          |
| nat          | Natal           |
| poa          | Porto Alegre    |
| rec          | Recife          |
| rio          | Rio de Janeiro  |
| sal          | Salvador        |
| sgo          | Sao Gon√ßalo     |
| slz          | Sao Luis        |
| spo          | Sao Paulo       |

**Read *accessibility* estimates**

To download accessibility estimates, you can use the `read_access()` function. The
example below downloads data on accessibility by walking for the city of Curitiba, 
in Southern Brazil. The function will download data for the year 2019, which is the 
one currently available.

`read_access()` can also download the spatial geometry of each city by setting
`geometry = TRUE`, which can be used to map accessibility levels across the
city. Refer to the [mapping population and land use](landuse_maps.html) and
[mapping urban accessibility](access_maps.html) vignettes for examples of how
to use the spatial geometry information. For now, we'll set `geometry = FALSE` to 
download a dataframe with no spatial information. 

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# load the aopdata package
library(aopdata)

# A dataframe, with no spatial geometry
cur <- read_access(city = 'Curitiba', 
                   mode = 'public_transport', 
                   year = 2019, 
                   geometry = FALSE,
                   showProgress = FALSE)
```

Let's check the results:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
dplyr::glimpse(cur)
```

As you can see, a lot of data has been returned from `read_access()`. The dataframe's
columns can be classified into 4 groups, according to the data they contain: _geographic_,
_sociodemographic_, _land use_, and _accessibility_. The following section explains 
the contents of each column.

## Next Steps

Now, check the next vignettes for demonstrations on how to use `aopdata` to produce 
[land use](landuse_maps.html) and [accessibility](access_maps.html) maps, as well 
as to analzse [accessibility inequalities](access_inequality.html).
