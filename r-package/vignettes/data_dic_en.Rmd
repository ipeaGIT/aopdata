# Accessibility indicators

#### Organization of the columns with accessibility estimates
The name of the columns with accessibility estimates are the junction of three components: 1) Type of accessibility indicator 2) Type of opportunity / population 3) Time thresold

### 1) Type of accessibility indicator

| Indicator |      Description                                         | Observation         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| CMA	      | Cumulative opportunity measure (active)  | |
| CMP	      | Cumulative opportunity measure (passive) | |
| TMI       | Travel time to closest opportunity       | Value = Inf when travel time is longer than 2h (public transport or car) or 1,5h (walking or bicycle) |


### 2) Type of opportunity / population
		
| Type of opportunity	| Description	| Observation: available in combination with  |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| TT	| All jobs | CMA indicator |
| TB	| Jobs with primary education | CMA indicator |
| TM	| Jobs with secundary education | CMA indicator |
| TA	| Jobs with tertiary education | CMA indicator |
| ST	| All healthcare facilities | CMA and TMI indicators |
| SB	| Healthcare facilities - Low complexity | CMA and TMI indicators |
| SM	| Healthcare facilities - Medium complexity | CMA and TMI indicators |
| SA	| Healthcare facilities - High complexity | CMA and TMI indicators |
| ET	| All public schools | CMA and TMI indicators |
| EI	| Public schools - early childhood | CMA and TMI indicators |
| EF	| Public schools - elementary schools | CMA and TMI indicators |
| EM	| Public schools - high schools | CMA and TMI indicators |
| MT	| All school enrollments | CMA and TMI indicators |
| MI	| School enrollments - early childhood | CMA and TMI indicators |
| MF	| School enrollments - elementary schools | CMA and TMI indicators |
| MM	| School enrollments - high schools | CMA and TMI indicators |
| CT	| All Social Assistance Reference Centers (CRAS) | CMA and TMI indicators |

| People      	| Description	 | Observation: available in combination with |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| PT     |	All population | CMP indicator |
| PH     |	Men | CMP indicator |
| PM     |	Women | CMP indicator |
| PB     |	White population | CMP indicator |
| PA     |	Asian-descendent population | CMP indicator |
| PI     |	Indiginous population | CMP indicator |
| PN     |	Back population | CMP indicator |
| P0005I |	Population between 0 and 5 years old | CMP indicator |
| P0614I |	Population between 6 and 14 years old | CMP indicator |
| P1518I |	Population between 15 and 18 years old | CMP indicator |
| P1924I |	Population between 19 and 24 years old | CMP indicator |
| P2539I |	Population between 25 and 39 years old | CMP indicator |
| P4069I |	Population between 40 and 69 years old | CMP indicator |
| P70I   |	Population with 70 years old or more | CMP indicator |


### 3) Time thresold (only applicable to CMA and CMP estimates)
| Time thresold	| Description	 | Observation: only applicable to |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 15	| Opportunities accessible within 15 min.  | Active transport modes   |
| 30	| Opportunities accessible within 30 min.  | All transport modes      |
| 45	| Opportunities accessible within 45 min.  | Active transport modes   |
| 60	| Opportunities accessible within 60 min.  | All transport modes      |
| 90	| Opportunities accessible within 90 min.  | Public transport and car |
| 120	| Opportunities accessible within 120 min. | Public transport and car |


# Exemples	
- **CMAEF30**:	Numer of elementary schools accessible within 30 minutes
- **TMISB**:	Travel time from to the closest healthcare facility with low complextiy services
- **CMPPM60**: Number of women who can access a given hexagon cell in under 60 minutes
