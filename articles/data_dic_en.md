## Accessibility indicators

##### Organization of the columns with accessibility estimates

The name of the columns with accessibility estimates are the junction of
three components: 1) Type of accessibility indicator 2) Type of
opportunity / population 3) Time threshold

#### 1) Type of accessibility indicator
